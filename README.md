# Equipped
(This project is currently in development)
  - This is a film & photography equipment management application, meant to help collectives, media companies, or rental houses maintain accountability for all the bits and pieces that make up a production.
  - Each item has tech-specifications listed.
  - In later versions, users will be able to share their production kits with the rest of the App and get feedback and ratings.
  - Renting out items based on location and reputation could be a future addition.
