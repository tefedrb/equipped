# Equipped
Equipped is a video & photography equipment management application, meant to help film collectives, media companies, or rental houses keep track of their equipment. A user can browse a catalog of items and stash the ones they own into their company inventory. There is a feature that allows you to see who has what piece of equipment checked out, along with a history of the usage. Included in the application is a forum feature that allows a company to communicate.

I made this app after thinking about my time working for a small media company that could have used an equipment manager. This application would have been a good aid for keeping track of who was using what and when.

### What kind of application is this?
Equipped is a dockerized full-stack application with a microservice architecture backend built with Spring Boot, and a React.js frontend.

Note:
I built a web scraper (my "yoink" repository) with Puppeteer that programatically collects links and details about equipment from a particular rental house and stores it in a JSON file, which is then saved to your computer. I inserted that file into this project such that when you start up this application, the equipment-api populates a database with all the information from that JSON file, which is then used in the view (React), allowing a user to browse for and add equipment to their companies inventory.

## Requirements
- Docker
- Java 8
- Node.js

## ðŸ›  ðŸš€ Installation & Set Up
1. Clone the repository.

3. Make sure your ports are clear (8182, 8181, 8082, 8080, 8761, 5432 - refer to docker-compose.yml for services that will run).

4. Docker Desktop should be up and running & allowed to use 3.00 GB of memory. Check this by opening up preferences and navigating to Resources and then Advanced. There you should see a Memory slider that you should adjust accordingly.

5. From the equipped directory in your terminal, use the command: 
    ```sh
    docker-compose up
    ```
5. You can check to see if everything is up and running by using this command in a new terminal tab (note: depending on your machine it might take a few minutes for docker to build all the services for you):
     ```sh
    docker ps -a
    ```
6. If everything is up and running, you should see something like:
```

```
7. cd into the client folder, which you'll find in the project directory, and use the command:
    ```sh
    npm run start
    ```
8. This will start a server at ```http://localhost:3000/``` where you'll find your local view.
